# Developer Notes

flask is pulling an error in vs code with pylance stating that flask is not installed but the dev server is running and working. The following fixes have been tried: reinstalling flask with pip, reinitializing the .venv environment, selecting the python interpretor from the command palete in vs code. For now this is commented out with an ignore statement to relieve us of the pylance error.
